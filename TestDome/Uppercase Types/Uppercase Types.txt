Uppercase Types

The following code initializes strings as three different types and attempts to make them uppercase. Which statements about the behavior of the typescript compiler are correct?

let stringType: string = "string type";
stringType.toUpperCase();

let anyType: any = "any type";
anyType.toUpper();
anyType.toUpperCase();

let objectType: Object = "object type";
objectType.toUpperCase();


x	The typescript compiler confirms that toUpperCase exists on the stringType instance.

	The typescript compiler states that toUpper does not exist on the anyType instance;

	The typescript compiler confirms that toUpperCase exists on the anyType instance.

x	The typescript compiler does not check if toUpperCase or toUpper exist on the anyType instance.

x	The typescript compiler states that the toUpperCase function does not exist on the objectType instance.

	The typescript compiler confirms that the toUpperCase function exists on the objectType instance.
