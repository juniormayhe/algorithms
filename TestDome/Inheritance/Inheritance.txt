A class inherits a base class and it overrides a method from that base class.

Select all possible forms of the base class and its method:

	The base class can be sealed/NotInheritable.

x	The base class can be abstract/MustInherit.

x	The method from the base class can be abstract/MustOverride.

x	The method from the base class can be virtual/Overridable.

	The method from the base class does not need to have any modifier.

	The method from the base class can have only a protected modifier.
