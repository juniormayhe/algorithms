Information about pets is kept in two separate tables:

TABLE dogs
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL

TABLE cats
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  
Identify all the queries that select all distinct pet names.

	SELECT DISTINCT name FROM dogs, cats;
x	SELECT DISTINCT name FROM dogs UNION SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;
	SELECT DISTINCT name FROM dogs UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;
x	SELECT name FROM dogs UNION SELECT name FROM cats;
	SELECT name FROM dogs UNION ALL SELECT name FROM cats;
