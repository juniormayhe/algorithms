Which statements are true for the .NET technologies you can use to process XML data?

	System.Xml.XmlReader.Create(Stream stream) builds an internal model that holds the whole XML file.

x	System.Xml.Linq.XElement can be used to modify the existing XML file.

x	System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer should be used only when the XML stream is expected to conform to a known XML schema.

x	System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Load(Stream stream) builds an internal model that holds the whole XML file.

	Executing System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Load(Stream stream) is faster than executing System.Xml.XmlReader.Create(Stream stream).
