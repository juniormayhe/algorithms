Each item in a web shop belongs to a different seller. To ensure service quality, each seller has a rating.

The data are kept in the following two tables:

TABLE sellers
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL

TABLE items
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  sellerId INTEGER REFERENCES sellers(id)
Write a query that selects the item name and the name of its seller for each item that belongs to a seller with a rating of more than 4.


-- Write only the SQL statement that solves the problem and nothing else.
select 
i.name, s.name
from sellers s 
inner join items i on i.sellerId = s.id
where rating>4
